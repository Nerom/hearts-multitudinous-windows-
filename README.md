# hearts-multitudinous-windows-
write for girls too,This use multitudinous transparent windows. This is the improved version of the other hearts program.This program is some alike my previous project: https://github.com/Nerom/hearts-one-window- . Because of the difference of the implementation is too obviouse, I split it into two projects.
# Run it
please use visual studio 2012 to load and compile the program. If you have other C compilers, you can migrate to your C projects as well. I guess you need to google it , cause I don't know how to migrate either...
# Lisence
This code is under GPL.
# Attention
If you guys get a better sulotion to improve the effect of the program please fork this and contact me !Thank you very much!
# Wish
I wish you guys get your right girls.
